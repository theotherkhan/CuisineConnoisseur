### HOW TO RUN:
1. path to the directory with driver.py, NN.py, setup.py, recipe.py, jsonReader.py, and run.sh
2. make sure to include in that directory ingredients.json and training.json
3. execute `./run.sh`
  * NOTE: the bash script is currently configured to operate on ingredients.json and training.json; if you wish to change this, simply change those input statements for another json of attributes and training data.
